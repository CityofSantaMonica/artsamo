# How to hide an event page

While [editing[(https://github.com/jimthoburn/artsamo/blob/master/_how-to/make-changes.markdown) an event file, look for the `published` line:
```
title: Meet me at Reed
published: true
```

(If you donâ€™t see the `published` line, you can add it.)

To hide the event, set the value of published to `false`:
```
title: Meet me at Reed
published: false
```

To show the event again, set the value of published to `true`.
```
title: Meet me at Reed
published: true
```
