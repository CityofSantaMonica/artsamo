# How to see a preview of your changes

If you’d like to see how your changes will look on the website before making them public, you can work in the [staging branch](https://github.com/jimthoburn/artsamo/tree/staging)–a copy of the website files, that’s published at https://staging-artsamo.digitalservice.la

You can make edits in the staging branch and commit them just as you would normally. They’ll automatically appear on the staging website within a few minutes.

Once you’re happy with how your changes look on the staging website, you can copy them over to the [public website](https://beta-artsamo.digitalservice.la) (the `master` branch) using a pull request. Here are the steps:

1. Press the “new pull request” button.
