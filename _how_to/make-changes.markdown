# How to make changes

The website is published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and the files are generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

As you make changes and commit/push them to GitHub, the [website](https://beta-artsamo.digitalservice.la) will automatically update.

For example, if you [edit the _About_ page](https://github.com/jimthoburn/artsamo/edit/master/about.md) on GitHub, and then press the “Commit changes” button–you should see your changes on the [_About_ page](https://beta-artsamo.digitalservice.la/about/) of the website within a few minutes.
