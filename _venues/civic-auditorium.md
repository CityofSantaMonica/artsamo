The Civic Auditorium
====================================

Designed by noted architect Welton Beckett, the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium opened in 1958. This local landmark is currently being used sparingly, but in 2018, the City issued an RFP for its future development and management. We’re working hard to restoring it to its rightful purpose of offering world-class entertainment.

Information on facility rental: coming soon...
