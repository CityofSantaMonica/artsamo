### Santa Monica Arts Commission

Art is such a critical component of life in Santa Monica. And we always need more art. The Santa Monica Arts Commission is an 11-member advisory body appointed by the City Council, whose goal is to encourage the flow of art into the City. We’d love to hear your ideas on how we can do that even better. Please join us at one of our meetings.

We meet the third Monday of each month, Ken Edwards Center, 6:30 p.m.

Cultural Policy
---------------

Art is fluid and ever-changing. And so are the City’s Cultural Policies in regard to art. The SMCA helps shape those policies through listening to our community. We learn what’s important, then work hard to bring it to fruition. There’s nothing like seeing something beautiful that you helped create come to life.

Cultural Planning
-----------------

We’re always looking for ways to remain fresh. That’s why we’re excited to announce our 2019 Cultural Planning. This yearlong process will help craft a collective vision for the future of art in Santa Monica, and will seek input from our valued community members. That means you! Stay tuned.

Maintenance of Collection
-------------------------

Maintaining the original, inspirational appearance of our vast art collection requires constant care. In 2015, the Santa Monica Cultural Affairs Public Art team commissioned Rosa Lowinger and Associates to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment. Now regular maintenance on our most important pieces ensures they’ll be around for years to come.

Ordinances
----------

In art, there are no rules. There are, however, ordinances. These ordinances encourage and offer protection to the creation of public art. The Santa Monica Cultural Affairs’ Public Art Program operates under these ordinances and policies, in collaboration with City staff, the Arts Commission, the Public Art Committee and City Council.
