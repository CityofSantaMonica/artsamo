Welcome to Beach=Culture, a year-round series of free arts and culture events at the Annenberg Community Beach House. Beach=Culture features exhibitions, artist residencies, literary programs and other scheduled and pop-up arts experiences. Come down to the beach and find the unexpected - poetry amidst the swimmers, sculpture alongside volleyball players, dance in the middle of the sand.

    The unbroken horizon between ocean and sky is one of the most iconic images of Los Angeles. For those of us born and raised in California, the horizon is part of our everyday life, we may take for granted as just another beautiful view in our home city. For the thousands of immigrants who have come to Los Angeles over generations, the horizon over the Pacific Ocean is a symbol of hope, freedom, and the promise of new life.
