Go See Art
==========

You will never regret taking time out of your busy day to go see art. Santa Monica offers a rich collection of public art, self-produced art and more. Get out there, drink it in and let it refresh your soul. You can’t see it all, of course. But you can try.

Public Art
----------

Our City’s diverse creative population is reflected through art, and it’s essential to our City. So that you can enjoy as much of it as possible, we’re dedicated to integrating it into our community’s daily life. Be sure to notice it each day, and seek it out in areas you don’t normally visit.
