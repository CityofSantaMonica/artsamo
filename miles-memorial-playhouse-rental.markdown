Theater Rental <small>at Miles Memorial Playhouse</small>
=========================================================

The Miles Memorial Playhouse charter, as approved by the City Council, states that the Miles Memorial Playhouse is available solely to non-profit organizations presenting performing arts events (music, theater and dance) that are open to the general public and appropriate for youth. (“Youth” is defined as 24 and under.) We are also available for general performing arts-related rehearsals, single events and readings when schedule allows.

We book the Playhouse **6 months in advance**. Proposals for calendar months March – July must be received no later than the third Friday of the previous SEPTEMBER. All proposals received by this day will receive priority consideration. Applicants will be notified of acceptance or denial by the end of September. Proposals for calendar months August – December must be received no later than the third Friday in March of the same year. All proposals received by this day will receive priority consideration. Applicants will be notified of acceptance or denial by the end of March. Please allow the widest possible range of dates for your production within those time frames.

We **do not** rent the playhouse for private events such as weddings, bar mitzvahs, benefits, fundraisers, birthday parties or social clubs. We **do not** rent the playhouse to for-profit entities or producers unless they are affiliated with a non-profit and dedicating proceeds to that approved organization.

## Definitions

### Weekly Rental

A “Weekly Rental” reserves the Theater, Green Room and Auditorium for a user group from Monday at 9 a.m. through Sunday at 11 p.m., except for the 2nd and 4th Tuesday evenings of every month (to be discussed with Playhouse Manager). It includes 25 hours of free time, primarily used during the first week (load-in week), and up to 4 scheduled public performances between Thursday at 6 p.m. through Sunday at 11 p.m. Most rentals perform Friday and Saturday night at 8 p.m., with two shows on Sunday (2 p.m. and 7 p.m.). Some choose to do a single show Thursday – Sunday. Others choose to do only two or three shows. Performance start times are up to user group but must be approved by Playhouse Director.

Single weekend evening rentals do not include free tech and rehearsal time, which will be billed at $20 per hour, as arranged with Playhouse Staff.

For those organizations that have already booked a Weekly Rental, the opportunity to add a fifth show is available for an additional $300 charge.

### Single Weekend Matinee

These are individually scheduled low-tech, low-prop shows, geared toward the toddler and pre-teen audience. Up to two performances per weekend day will be allowed. The show must be under one hour in length, and must be struck (clear of the theater) by 4:00 p.m. Single weekend matinee rates are $150 per show.
