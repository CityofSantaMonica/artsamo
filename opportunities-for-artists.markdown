The Artist Roster, a curated shortlist of artists, will enable us to connect amazing qualified artists to projects and opportunities in Santa Monica.

All entities using the Santa Monica Cultura Affairs’ prequalified roster will be strongly encouraged to budget artists' fees when planning potential projects.
