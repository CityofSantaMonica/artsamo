To ensure a robust arts and culture ecosystem for both residents and visitors to the City, Cultural Affairs offers five grant programs for Santa Monica-based arts and heritage nonprofits.

Organizational Support Program (OSP)
------------------------------------

General operating support grants are vital to a thriving cultural scene. Santa Monica’s Organizational Support Program (OSP) was created in 1996 to provide multiyear support to the City’s nonprofit cultural institutions. This robust program makes grants of up to ten percent of local organizations’ budgets. Grants are awarded after an application process, currently on a two-year cycle.

Resident organizations are defined as those whose primary administrative office and primary location of programming (more than 50%) are within Santa Monica city limits. Organizations receiving grants will:

*   Increase world-class artistic production and exhibition in Santa Monica
*   Offer opportunities for creativity, artistic participation and greater understanding of cultural heritage to diverse members of the community
*   Promote high standards of organizational management
*   Position the City as an international creative center
