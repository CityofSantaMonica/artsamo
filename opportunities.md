Opportunities for Artists
=========================

You can never have enough art. And that means you can never have enough artists. Our Cultural Affairs Division helps welcome and cultivate artists through grants and residencies for both individual artists and organizations.

Artist Fellowship
-----------------

Deadline: TBA (early January 2019) | [Guidelines](https://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Portals/Culture/Grants/Santa_Monica_Artist_Fellowship/Santa%20Monica%20Artist%20Fellowship%20Guidelines%202018-19%20ES-US.pdf)

Applications Will Be Available: TBA (early January 2019)

Support of the arts comes in many forms. For a few fortunate local artists, that support is financial. The Santa Monica Artist Fellowship offers two annual grants of $20,000 and three project fellowships of $4,200 each. Could you use the support? We encourage you to apply today.

### Eligibility

Professional artists who create, rather than interpret, original work, and who either reside in the City or maintain a studio and business license in the city, are eligible to apply. Applicants must have met the residency requirements for at least one year. (Five years for nominated Fellows.)

Artist Residencies
------------------

Santa Monica strives to cultivate not only local artists, but also artists from other areas. Our Artist Residency programs help to welcome other artists, and therefore other experiences and perspectives. We offer many types of residencies at both the Annenberg Community Beach House and the Camera Obscura Art Lab.

Artists can never have too much support. So the Organizational Support Program (OSP) was created by the City of Santa Monica. The OSP provides ongoing support to our City’s cornerstone cultural institutions by offering multi-year grants to many different arts and culture organizations.

Resident organizations are defined as those whose primary administrative office and primary location of programming (more than 50%) are within Santa Monica city limits. Organizations receiving grants will:

* Increase world-class artistic production and exhibition in Santa Monica
* Offer opportunities for creativity, artistic participation and greater understanding of cultural heritage to diverse members of the community
* Promote high standards of organizational management
* Position the City as an international creative center
* Open avenues of discourse to broad topics of human creativity and learning among the general public

### Community Access & Participation

Deadline: TBA (April 2019) | Instructions and [Guidelines](https://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Portals/Culture/Grants/CAP_Grant_Program/CAP%20Program%20Guidelines%202018-19.pdf) |

Applications Will Be Available: February/March 2019

Future artists are everywhere, and we want to find and nurture them. Santa Monica’s Community Access & Participation (CAP) program provides grants of up to $7,000 to nonprofit arts organizations for cultural programs in all media. Projects must take place in Santa Monica. We also offer grants specifically for Santa Monica’s youth (Building the Future) and its rich Latino heritage (Latino CAP). Help us get the word out to budding artists everywhere.

Arts Transportation Grant Programs
----------------------------------

How might one child’s life change by being exposed to the arts? Applying for a grant that reimburses you for transportation costs can make it possible.

The City of Santa Monica Arts Transportation Grant Program provides access to arts and culture activities throughout Los Angeles County. Any Santa Monica school or nonprofit organization who wants to take their students to visit a cultural destination in L.A. County may apply for reimbursement of transportation costs. Trips must take place between **October 1, 2017 and June 7, 2018.**

There’s no deadline for applications, but we suggest you apply by mid-November 2018 to ensure funds are available.  | Instructions & Guidelines |

Applications Will Be Available: September 7, 2018

Support for this program comes from the Metropolitan Transit Authority’s Proposition A Local Return funds.
